# CarND-Controls-PID
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

## Overview
The objective of this project was to imlplement a PID controller to steer a car in the Udacity's simulator.

## Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation
If only the P component is used to control the cars steering angle, the car car will drive wavy lines with increasing amplitudes and finally drive off the road.
The D component lets the car from driving more straight and prevents the wavy lines nearly completely. The car does not leave the track.
The I component improves the steering of the car when in the curves where it keeps the car more away from the outer curbs. The drawback of the I components is that it will make the steering more sensitive to noisy input data which are occur at both ends of the bridge.

## Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen.
Choosing the right hyperparameters is a tricky task because they are known to depend on the parameters of the control loop. In this project the parameters of the control loop depend on the speed of the car. My first step was to imeplement a PD controller to control the speed of the car. Then I tried to find the optimal parameters using the twiddle algorithm which was presented in the lesson. For this I let go the car for 3500 frames, calculated the overall error and reset the simulator. In contrast to what I expected, the overall error was varying from one round to the other. Therefore it was not suitable to be the criterion for the twiddle algorithm and I decided to tuned the hyperparameters manually. 
Finally, I implemented a algorithm to reduce the setpoint of the speed controller on high cross track errors. This is useful especially in the curves were the car brakes and stays more away from the outer curbs. The maximum speed the car can go on my notebook is about 70 mph.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
